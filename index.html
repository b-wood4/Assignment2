            <p>A feature that I'm excited about that's been released in the last 5 years is the has() selector. This
                feature allows you to select any tag with a relative selector. This could allow for quicker
                modifications to multiple elements, which would be beneficial for me, as I can't make a final decision
                on anything and love to make minor adjustments to multiple elements 'just to see'.</p>

            <p> The best thing I've learned how to use in CSS would be auto sizing for image and video elements, as well
                as media queries to check for screen size and adjusting media size accordingly. This
                will come in handy for the second assignment, where I plan to make a website that can be used on various
                types of screens. This layout would have probably worked a bit better if I made the picture of my dog
                smaller, but she's so cute that I didn't want to. </p>
